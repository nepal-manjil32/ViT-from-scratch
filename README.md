# ViT-from-Scratch  (Will add the complete code soon)

Hardcoded the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture using PyTorch and trained it on a custom dataset. This repository includes model implementation, training pipeline, and evaluation.  

## Features  
- Custom-built ViT architecture in PyTorch  
- Trained on a custom dataset  
- Supports dataset preprocessing and augmentation  
- Evaluation and performance metrics  

## Installation  
Clone the repository:
